# Walking Dude (the epic game)

A dude trying to avoid tourists with selfie sticks.
This is me learning to use [Python Arcade](http://arcade.academy) library, 
and to put some AI (i.e. [Reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning) ) in it later on

# To run the game

```
python manual.py
```

# Code quality

Current code quality - according to my super advanced calculations - is 1/10 :)
