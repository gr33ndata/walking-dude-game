A dude trying to avoid tourists with selfie sticks.

This is me learning to use [Python Arcade](http://arcade.academy) library, 
and to put some AI (i.e. [Reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning) ) in it later on

# To run the game

Make sure to have Python 3.6+, and to install the libraries needed

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run:

```
python manual.py
```

# Code quality

Current code quality - according to my super advanced calculations - is 1/10 :)
